/**
 * Bottom session strip (parity sweep item 5) — a horizontal-scroll row of
 * roster cards replacing the old top-chrome session chips + left sidebar,
 * used in 'garden' and 'terminal' view modes (App.tsx decides which; the two
 * "Full" modes keep the previous topbar chips instead — see App.tsx's own
 * comment for why). "+ new agent" sits at the strip's end, not in the top
 * bar. The cards themselves are unchanged (AgentRosterCard) — this is
 * placement/orientation only.
 *
 * Scoped to the ACTIVE workspace's sessions (Phase 8.7) — a session in
 * another workspace has no card here until you switch to it. Arceus is
 * global (`useActiveWorkspaceSessions` includes him regardless of which
 * workspace is active) and filtered out of the ordinary `sessions` list
 * below (he isn't a plain session card, and his live/dead session lifecycle
 * shouldn't gate his presence here) — instead he gets his own permanent,
 * gold-framed `ArceusRosterCard`, pinned first, rendered unconditionally so
 * he's always here, even in a workspace with no sessions at all.
